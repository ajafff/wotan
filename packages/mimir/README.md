## Purpose

This library contains all core rules, formatters and configuration presets of the Fimbullinter project. As a typical user you don't need to explicitly install this package. It's already installed as a dependency of Wotan.

## Rules

Rule | Description | Difference to TSLint rule / Why you should use it
---- | ---- | ----
[`await-async-result`](docs/await-async-result.md) | :mag: Warns about not using the result of a call to an async function inside async functions. | TSLint's `no-floating-promises` requires you to specify a list of Promise names, it checks outside of async functions and only requires you to register the `onrejected` callback.
[`await-only-promise`](docs/await-only-promise.md) | :mag: :wrench: Finds uses of `await` on non-Promise values. Also checks `for await` loops. | Works for all `PromiseLike` and `Thenable` types out of the box without any configuration.
[`ban-dom-globals`](docs/ban-dom-globals.md) | :mag: Disallows uses of global variables like `name` or `event`. Using these variables is most likely not intended. | There's an open PR to add a similar rule to TSLint.
[`delete-only-optional-property`](docs/delete-only-optional-property.md) | :mag: Disallows `delete` of required properties. | There's no similar TSLint rule.
[`generator-require-yield`](docs/generator-require-yield.md) | Requires at least one `yield` inside generator functions. | There's no similar TSLint rule.
[`new-parens`](docs/new-parens.md) | :wrench: Requires parentheses when invoking constructors. | Performance!
[`no-case-declaration`](docs/no-case-declaration.md) | Disallows `let`, `class` and `enum` in case blocks. | TSLint has no similar rule, ESLint has `no-case-declarations` which forbids function declarations as well.
[`no-debugger`](docs/no-debugger.md) | :wrench: Bans `debugger;` statements from your production code. | Performance!
[`no-duplicate-case`](docs/no-duplicate-case.md) | :mag_right: Detects `switch` statements where multiple `case` clauses check for the same value. | This implementation tries to infer the value instead of just comparing the source code.
[`no-duplicate-spread-property`](docs/no-duplicate-spread-property.md) | :mag: Detects properties in object literals with object spread that are always overridden. | TSLint has no such rule.
[`no-fallthrough`](docs/no-fallthrough.md) | Prevents unintentional fallthough in `switch` statements from one case to another. | Allows more comment variants such as `fallthrough` or `fall through`.
[`no-inferred-empty-object`](docs/no-inferred-empty-object.md) | :mag: Detects type parameters that are inferred as `{}` because the compiler cannot infer a type. | Really checks every type parameter of function, method and constructor calls. Correctly handles type parameters from JSDoc comments. Recognises type parameter defaults on all merged declarations.
[`no-invalid-assertion`](docs/no-invalid-assertion.md) | :mag: Disallows asserting a literal type to a different literal type of the same widened type, e.g. `'foo' as 'bar'`.| TSLint has no similar rule.
[`no-misused-generics`](docs/no-misused-generics.md) | Detects generic type parameters that cannot be inferred from the functions parameters. It also detects generics that don't enforce any constraint between types. | There's no similar TSLint rule.
[`no-nan-compare`](docs/no-nan-compare.md) | Disallows comparing with `NaN`, use `isNaN(number)` or `Number.isNaN(number)` instead. | Performance!
[`no-octal-escape`](docs/no-octal-escape.md) | :wrench: Disallows octal escape sequences in strings and template strings. | No such rule in TSLint.
[`no-return-await`](docs/no-return-await.md) | Disallows unnecesary `return await foo;` when you can simply `return foo;` | The same as TSLint's rule. I wrote both, but this one is faster.
[`no-unassigned-variable`](docs/no-unassigned-variable.md) | Detects variables that are not initialized and never assigned a value. | There's no similar TSLint rule.
[`no-unreachable-code`](docs/no-unreachable-code.md) | Disallows statements that will never be executed. | TSLint removed their `no-unreachable` rule in v4.0.0.
[`no-unsafe-finally`](docs/no-unsafe-finally.md) | Disallows control flow statements `return`, `throw`, `break` and `continue` inside the `finally` block of a try statement. | Performance!
[`no-unstable-api-use`](docs/no-unstable-api-use.md) | :mag: Disallows uses of deprecated or experimental APIs. | This rule checks element accesses (`foo[bar]`), JSX elements, chained function calls (`getFn()()`) in addition to what TSLint's `deprecation` rule does and has more useful error reporting.
[`no-unused-expression`](docs/no-unused-expression.md) | :nut_and_bolt: Disallows side-effect free expressions whose value is not used. | This one is a bit stricter than TSLint's `no-unused-expression` and checks `for` loops in addition.
[`no-unused-label`](docs/no-unused-label.md) | :wrench: Disallows labels that are never used. | TSLint only has `label-position` which doesn't check for unused labels.
[`no-useless-assertion`](docs/no-useless-assertion.md) | :mag: :wrench: Disallows type assertions that don't change the type or are not necessary in the first place. | TSLint's `no-unnecessary-type-assertion` does not detect assertions needed to silence the compiler warning `Variable ... is used before being assigned.` The Wotan builtin rule also checks whether the assertion is necessary at all or the receiver accepts the original type.
[`no-useless-declare`](docs/no-useless-declare.md) | :wrench: Disallows the `declare` keyword on statements without runtime value, e.g. `declare type T = any;`. | TSLint has no such rule.
[`no-useless-initializer`](docs/no-useless-initializer.md) | :mag_right: :wrench: Disallows unnecessary initialization with `undefined` and useless destructuring defaults. | TSLint's rule `no-unnecessary-initializer` doesn't fix all parameter initializers and gives false positives for destructuring.
[`no-useless-jump-label`](docs/no-useless-jump-label.md) | :wrench: Disallows `continue label;` and `break label;` where the label is not necessary. | There's no similar TSLint rule.
`no-useless-predicate` | Detects redundant conditions that are either always true or always false. *requires type information* | Combination of TSLint's `strict-type-predicates`, `typeof-compare` and parts of `strict-boolean-expressions`.
[`no-useless-spread](docs/no-useless-spread.md)` | :wrench: Disallows redundant array and object spread. | There's no similar TSLint rule.
`parameter-properties` | Enforces or disallows the use of parameter properties. This rule is **not** enabled in `wotan:recommended`. | TSlint only has `no-parameter-properties` to disallow all parameter properties and has no autofixer.
`prefer-const` | Prefer `const` for variables that are never reassigned. Use option `{destructuring: "any"}` if you want to see failures for each identifier of a destructuring, even if not all of them can be constants. The default is `{destructuring: "all"}`. | TSLint's `prefer-const` rule gives some false positives for merged declarations and variables used in before being declared which results in a compiler error after fixing.
`prefer-dot-notation` | Prefer `obj.foo` over `obj['foo']` where possible. | Same as TSLint's `no-string-literal` rule, but more performant.
`prefer-exponentiation-operator` | Prefer `a ** b` over `Math.pow(a, b)`. | No similar TSlint rule.
`prefer-for-of` | Prefer `for-of` loops over regular `for` loops where possible. *requires type information* | Avoids the false positives of TSLint's `prefer-for-of` rule.
`prefer-namespace-keyword` | Prefer `namespace foo {}` over `module foo {}` to avoid confusion with ECMAScript modules. | Same as TSLint's `no-internal-module`.
`prefer-number-methods` | Prefer ES2015's `Number.isNaN` and `Number.isFinite` over the global `isNaN` and `isFinite` mainly for performance. *requires type information* | No similar rule in TSLint.
`prefer-object-spread` | Prefer object spread over `Object.assign` for copying properties to a new object. *requires type information* | Performance, and better handling of parens in fixer and avoids false positives that would cause a compile error when fixed.
`return-never-call` | Prefer `return neverReturns();` or `throw neverReturns();` over plain calls to `neverReturns();` to enable better control flow analysis and type inference. | TSLint has no similar rule.
`syntaxcheck` | Reports syntax errors as lint errors. This rule is **not** enabled in `wotan:recommended`. *requires type information* | Used to be part of the deprecated `tslint --type-check`
`trailing-newline` | Requires a line break at the end of each file. | Nothing fancy here :(
`try-catch-return-await` | Companion of `no-return-await` because inside a try-catch block you should await returned promises to correctly enter the catch on rejection and/or the finally block after completion. *requires type information* | TSLint has no similar rule.
`type-assertion` | Enforces a single type assertion style: "classic" `<T>obj` or "as" `obj as T`. This rule is **not** enabled in `wotan:recommended`. | TSLint has only `no-angle-bracket-type-assertion` which always enforces `as` and forgets to add parens when autofixing some cases.
`typecheck` | TypeScript's compiler errors as lint errors. This rule is **not** enabled in `wotan:recommended`. *requires type information* | Like the deprecated `tslint --type-check` but formatted and can be disabled like any other rule.
