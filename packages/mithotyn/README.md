Make sure to also read the [full documentation of all available modules](https://github.com/fimbullinter/wotan#readme).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @fimbul/wotan @fimbul/mithotyn
# or
yarn add -D @fimbul/wotan @fimbul/mithotyn
```

## Usage

To enable this plugin, you need to add `@fimbul/mithotyn` as plugin in your `tsconfig.json`. For example:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      { "name": "@fimbul/mithotyn" }
    ],
    // your existing compilerOptions
    "strict": true,
  }
}
```

Make sure you have `@fimbul/wotan` installed in the project directory or a parent directory.

### Using your existing `.fimbullinter.yaml`

Like the CLI this plugin uses your configurations from a file named `.fimbullinter.yaml`. The main difference is that it doesn't only look for this file in the current directory but also in all parent directories.
This is necessary because there is likely only one `.fimbullinter.yaml` in the root of your workspace, but multiple TypeScript projects may exist in subdirectories.

The following options are used if present in that file. Note that all paths and modules are resolved relative to the directory containing this configuration file.

* `modules`: loads the specified plugin modules to customize linter behavior
* `config`: use the specified configuration file for all files
* `files`: only lint files matching one of the given glob patterns
* `exclude`: exclude files matching one of the given glob patterns

### Configuration Options

To customize your in-editor linting experience you can use the following configuration options:

* `displayErrorsAsWarnings: boolean`: Report findings with severity `error` as warning to make them distinguishable from real type errors (e.g. green instead of red squiggles in VS Code)

Example:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@fimbul/mithotyn",
        "displayErrorsAsWarnings": true
      }
    ],
    // your existing compilerOptions
    "strict": true,
  }
}
```

### Usage in VS Code

In Visual Studio Code you can choose between the version of TypeScript that comes bundled with the editor or the local one installed in the workspace.
Due to technical limitations you need to choose the workspace version to correctly pick up the plugin configured in the previous section.

* open command palette while a TypeScript or JavaScript file is opened
* select `TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version.`
* select `Use Workspace Version`

Other editors might work the same as VS Code.

To work around this limitation there is an editor plugin that automatically loads this LanguageService plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fimbullinter.vscode-plugin

## Limitations

There are some limitations of the current implementation.

* doesn't use processors at all

The following limitations will likely be fixed in future releases.

* Currently only works with TypeScript installed in your workspace, see [Usage in VS Code](#usage-in-vs-code)
* doesn't provide code fixes for findings
* doesn't validate `.wotanrc.yaml` and `.fimbullinter.yaml` files
* doesn't refresh lint findings if configuration changes; you need to reopen or change the file
